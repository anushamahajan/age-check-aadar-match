# ðŸ›‚ Age & Identity Verification System Using Simulated Government ID Cards
ScanIT: Smart Age & Identity Verification Using AI and Aadhar Simulation

This is a **proof-of-concept identity verification tool** that processes a simulated Aadhar card and compares the extracted photo with a live selfie to verify:
- If the person matches the ID photo
- If they meet an age requirement (e.g., 18+)

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Extract date of birth (DOB), Name and photo from a simulated Aadhar card (image or PDF)
- âœ… Capture a live selfie through a webcam or mobile camera
- âœ… Compare face from ID and selfie using facial embeddings
- âœ… Check if the extracted age meets threshold (e.g., 18+)
- âœ… Display a match confidence score (e.g., 87% match)
- âœ… Feedback if selfie is blurry or poorly lit *(in progress)*
